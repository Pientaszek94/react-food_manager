# Welcome!
This is FoodManager app that is simply Cookbook now, but its server and client side are a bit advanced. Here you can find Flask, JWT, MongoDB, React, GraphQL, Redux Toolkit, simple cookies,cropped images, Axios etc.. This first phase is to show how things can be combined. Next phase will be much more than a cookbook.
